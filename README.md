# Lucid Messages

## Overview

Lucid Messages is a secure messaging platform I'm developing to enhance user privacy, security, and scalability. It utilizes a microservice architecture and implements robust security measures including end-to-end encryption.

**Note: This project is currently a work in progress. Only authentication services (login, sign-up, forgot-password) have been implemented so far. I have every intention of completing the full messaging functionality in the future.**

## Current Features

- User authentication (login, sign-up)
- Password reset functionality
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
- Dockerized microservices
- React.js frontend
- Node.js and Python backend services

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Python (Flask)
- Database: MySQL
- Deployment: Docker, AWS EC2
- Load Balancing: Nginx
- Authentication: JWT
- Encryption: End-to-end encryption (in progress)

## Setup

(Detailed setup instructions will be provided once the project reaches a more complete state)
